# <u>SOP</u>

I am eager to join and contribute to the AI Community of IIT Bombay. I have a strong passion in Artifical Intelligence and machine learning. 
My goals are to work with like-minded individuals on innovative projects, take part in varous AI based hackathons representing the institute, enhance my knowledge and skills in the field of AI.

## Motivaton:

I first dived into the field of machine learning in the initial months of my first year. I got interested in how machine learning models can do complex tasks like object detection, image generation,real time caption generation and especially the Deepfake technology. So I started learning about these things first from youtube and then by taking varous deep learning courses on coursera. As I learned more and more about ML, my interest only grew more and more.

By joining the AIC, I want to contribute to projects like the recent InstiGPT, collabrate with fellow members and work in a team. By working with like-minded individuals, I can develop both technical and non-technical skills.
## Knowledge:

Due to the courses I took,I have much theorotical knowledge on how machine learning models like neural network works and how they are used in various fields like images, videos and audios. I also have knowledge on various python libraries like numpy, pandas, tensorflow, opencv. 

## Goals:
I want to learn and enhance my knowledge in various fields like deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision by working with skilled seniors on innovative projects. I also want to represent my institute in various hackathons.
